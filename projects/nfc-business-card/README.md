# Programmable NFC Business Card

## 当前确定方案

**R1 is the current editable engineering prototype.** Three front keys and a front e-paper display; rear NFC coil; right-centred recessed USB-C; two-layer 0.8 mm PCB; transparent printed enclosure, 85.2 × 53.2 × 5.8 mm. The selected battery is nominally 31 × 12 × 3 mm.

**Checkpoint, 2026-09-24:** routing and the existing checks pass, but a narrow ground-copper rim remains outside the screen keepout. Its removal, a 45° chamfered coil and equal offsets from the three exposed board edges are the next authorized revision. This checkpoint does not resolve that finding. RF tuning, battery measurements and physical assembly remain unverified.

## Physical validation still required

- Measure the complete protected battery, sealed edges and wires against the assumed 32.5 × 14 × 3.4 mm envelope.
- Fit the fully inserted display flex, printed enclosure, keys and USB plug; check screen-to-aperture alignment and adhesive retention.
- Bring up the assembled PCB and tune NFC with the final screen and enclosure. C23/C24 = 220 pF is provisional.

[Bench experiments](docs/nfc-bench-test.md) and [firmware](firmware/pn532_probe/) are separate from production-board qualification. No order has been placed.
